## Introduction

The WebSocket Game Application is a real-time multiplayer game that allows players to join games, send movements, and receive game updates in real-time using WebSocket connections.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`)
- Node.js and npm (for front-end development)
- [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) or a WebSocket client for testing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chisomd90/Game-API.git
   cd your-repo

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

```

3. Install Python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

4. Install front-end dependencies (if applicable):

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

1. Run the Flask application:
```
python your_app_name.py
```
The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
2. If your application includes a front-end, build and start the front-end development server:
```
cd frontend
npm run build

```
## Usage
1. Ensure the Flask application is running.
2. Use a WebSocket client to connect to the WebSocket server, e.g., using wscat:

```
wscat -c ws://localhost:5000

```
3. Test the WebSocket functionality as described in the application's testing instructions.
